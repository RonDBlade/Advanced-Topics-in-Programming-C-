1. Parse a maze
	a. Open a file from command line - verify if more than two cmd arguments are considered as error?
	b. Parse Header and check for errors in input file and print accordingly
	c. Check output file
	d. Check we have all needed characters in the maze
	e. Save maze in memory as a class of two dimentional char arrays
2. Create a player
	a. Should include: Current position, Previous position (verify if we can keep it), Bookmark position
	b. Logic: If stuck in a corner, enable moving to previous position, shouldn't move to previos position otherwise, generate possible moves set and remove previous position from it, try moving in a direction and remove it if it's blocked.
	c. Functions: move() - returns enum , 
	d. Check in forums: Can the player see the walls around him
3. Game Manager:
	a. Connects between player actions and the maze itself
	b. Loops for required steps
