Need for the game manager to keep all each location of each bookmark that was set.when one is stepped on,
we return him to the position he was at when stepping on that one,and giving the player knowledge on all the previous steps he has been 
to before putting that bookmark,including this bookmark(if we put  1 2 3 4 5 6 bookmarks,and stepped on bookmark 4,then the manager tells him
he stepped on 4,and removes bookmarks 1-4.the player can from that look at his vector of moves and infer what moves he did and "teleport"
himself to the location he was at according to the player map)
